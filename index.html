                    </div>
                    <div id="accordion">
                        <h3>Are you a realtor? Real Estate Broker? A Homeowner looking to move?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                <span>Our guess is that if you fall into any of these categories, that you want to sell a home.</span> This program is strategically designed to incentivize a prospective home buyer into making a purchase and works in synergy with our other marketing products to increase the probability of a home selling. The program is free—it literally costs you nothing. The only caveat is that in order to participate you must have bought at least one of our photo or video products. This is a very good deal when you consider that our photo and video products have some of the most competitive pricing on the market. The cost of the program is not baked into those products.
                            </p>
                            <p>The program entices prospective home buyers into making a purchase by of - fering them the opportunity to get funding for various money-saving sustain - ability projects, like <span>roof-top solar panels</span> , and <span>energy efficiency</span> in addi - tion to funding for permaculture style <span>carbon gardens</span> . These gardens are aesthetically pleasing landscaping in their own right, and can include food producing plants at the prospective-buyers request. </p>
                            <p>The idea of getting roof-top solar panels, energy efficiency upgrades, and car - bon gardens is exciting in and of itself because of the environmental aspect. In addition to this, the projects are specifically designed to lower the month - ly overhead of someone who purchases and moves into the home. This can help ease some of the anxiety a prospector buyer can feel when they look at a home and realize their overheard would be higher than their current living situation. There are no fees or costs.</p>

                                Our affiliate, <img src="carbon.png" /> ™ , is a crowdfunding platform that works with sustain - ability-minded impact-investors to raise money for solar projects, energy effi - ciency projects, and garden projects. We will determine if your home is suit - able for a solar installation, efficiency upgrade, or carbon garden. A quote is secured from professional contractors if the home meets <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ minimum requirement thresholds. After we know the cost of the project(s) and ha ve a professional contractor lined up for the job, we pay for the job with money from investors on <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ platform. The investors on

                            <p><img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ purchase the carbon rights for these projects by funding the se - cured project quote. These thresholds are based on several factors, like solar potential estimates, carbon emission reduction potential, and soil fertility.</p>
                            <p>When a prospective buyer expresses interest in purchasing the home, you can let them know that it is enrolled in <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ home-buyer incentive program, and that they may be eligible to receive funds from the crowdfunding plat - form.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <h3 class="tir2">How is eligibility determined?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                When we visit your home and take pictures and video, we also collect informa - tion and use advanced screening techniques to assess the home’s suitability for <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™

                            <p>
                                The platform is currently in development, and is not immediately available, but we collect the data needed to assess suitability for these project types when we visit your home. When the program is launched, if your home quali - fies based on the data we have collected, you will receive priority funding sta - tus and will be immediately notified
                            </p>

                        <h3 class="tir2">Priority Funding for the prospective buyer. 
Sounds great, but what does this mean?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Priority funding status means that if the prospective buyer makes a purchase, funders on <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ platform will be directed to this particular home’s proj - ects over other projects which are also looking for funding on the site. In this sense, they have priority over other homes which may be on the platform.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When a prospective buyer expresses interest in purchasing the home, you can let them know that it is enrolled in the home purchase incentive program and that they may qualify for funding if they purchase the home. You are allowed to market your enrollment in the program—however, we ask that you explain that it is pos - sible that the home may not qualify for funding if it does not meet <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ eligibility requirements and that the funding campaign could fail to reach 100% of the quote. This is the case with any Crowdfunding platform. If funding fails to reach 100% of the project quote, the prospective buyer.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <h3 class="tir2">Why would a 3rd party fund these projects? What are Carbon Rights?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Technically, no one is directly funding the project. Funders on <img src="carbon.png" /> ™ pur - chase the “Carbon Rights” to projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is why we can only offer enrollment in the program after a prospective buyer makes a home purchase. Once they own the home, they are able to sell the ‘carbon rights’ to funders on the platform, who in return provide the funds needed to implement the project. Ownership of Carbon Rights allows you to claim responsibility for the greenhouse-gas emission reduction caused by the sustainability project. In other words, if someone owns the carbon rights to the solar panels on your roof, they are the only ones who can claim that they have done something ‘green’ in relation to these projects. The prospective buyer receives all of the financial benefits of reduced overhead from the solar panels and efficiency upgrade, but cannot claim they are re - sponsible for reducing carbon emissions—this is owned by the project funders, based on the % of the quote that was committed.

                        <h3>Limitations</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Occasionally we will know right away that your home will not qualify for fund - ing for some or potentially all of <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ project types. If this is the case, we will notify you as soon as this is determined. Sustainability Services cannot guarantee the timing of an assessment, and is not liable for extenuating cir - cumstances which may cause a delay or absence of an assessment altogether
                            </p>
                            <p>Please understand that <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ is currently building out their platform. Al - though they anticipate a successful launch, there is always the possibility that something occurs which causes delays or the cessation of the platform launch itself. We cannot guarantee that the platform will succeed, therefore we cannot guaran - tee that you will have the opportunity to receive funding.</p>
                            <p>Also be aware that eligibility is determined relative to all other homes on the platform. With potentially limited funding, <img src="carbon.png" /> ™ has a responsibility to its funders to direct their money to projects which have the highest greenhouse gas reduction potential. In other words, you could get bumped out if a more suitable project makes its way onto the site. </p>
                            <p>Even if your home does meet <img src="carbon.png" />’s ™ ’ minimum requirement thresholds and begins a funding campaign, as is the case with any crowdfunding cam - paign, we cannot guarantee that the campaign will succeed. Although we hope this does not occur, we cannot control the actions of funders on the platform so there is al - ways the possibility that funding will not reach 100% of the project costs, or receive any funding at all.</p>
                            <p class="last">It’s important that you understand and consider these limitations, but also keep in mind that we do not charge for enrollment into the program, so there is very little risk.</p>
